# Weather App with an AI Suggestion

## Note

This repo uses deprecated tech stack since I built it long time ago. This is just a PoC work for API calling and deployment via Vercel processes.

## App Features

- **Live Weather Data**:  
  Fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for any city around the world.

- **AI Suggestion**:  
  Uses Google's "Gemini Flash 1.5" model via the OpenRouter API to provide AI-generated suggestions for clothing and umbrella recommendations based on the weather.

- **Multilanguage Support**:  
  Choose your preferred language using the navbar button (supports at least English and Turkish).
